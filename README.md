# Drug-Recommending-System
Ref: https://nbviewer.org/github/elfhub97/Drug-Recommending-System/blob/main/DRUG%20Prescribtion.ipynb
## Objective
To design a Drug Recommending system based on patient condition.

## Data
Licence: CC0: Public Domain

## The prediction sets are:

Drug type

## The feature sets are:

Age\
Sex\
Blood Pressure Levels (BP)\
Cholesterol Levels\
Na to Potassium Ration

We have to predict the drug which is appropriate to treat to a patient based on details diven in the feature sets. By using trained data we can predict the recommened drug when new test data is given by user.

ML Algorthims Used:
* KNN Classifier
* Random Forest Classifier
* Bagging Classifier
* Adaboost Classifier
* Gradientboot Classifier
* Decision Tree Classifier
